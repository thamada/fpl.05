    *** PPR: WARNING 5527: 
          The design uses no global buffers (BUFGS or BUFGP). Their use can
          improve performance for clocks or widely distributed signals.

    *** PPR: WARNING 7034: 
          In categories of paths that have NO timing specifications, the design
          has 2 path end-point pairs.  Note that there may be multiple paths
          between any listed pair of end-points.  To limit the number of paths
          reported in each category, set PPR parameter show_tsi_paths = <value>.
