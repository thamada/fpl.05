DES stands for Data Encryption Standard. It is an encryption 
algorithm which takes a 64bit key (56bit value plus 8 bit parity)
and encrypts data in 64bit blocks.  The algorithm uses 16 iterations
of identical operations performed with a set of 48bit subkeys.
Subkeys are permutations of the original key.

"des" is an implementation of DES on the DEC Pamette board
using PamDC interface and Pamblox abstraction level modules.  The
main design sits in LCA1 of the Pamette board, with SRAM interface
to the upper SRAM in LCA0.  The design uses a fixed key to 
encrypt incoming data from the upper SRAM and outputs encrypted 
data to the lower SRAM.  Data is shited in and out of the design 
in 16bit chunks, interpreted in little endian mode.  For testing 
purposes, a MSB of 1 indicates valid data.
